This is a simple and interactive Rock Paper Scissors game made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The player competes against the computer, and the game keeps track of both scores in real-time.
It features hover effects, dynamic result messages, and a clean user interface. 
This project was built to practice JavaScript fundamentals like event handling, conditional logic, and DOM manipulation.
