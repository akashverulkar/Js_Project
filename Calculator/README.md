This is a fully functional calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage,
and supports decimal input and double zero. 
The UI is clean and minimal, designed with a modern dark theme to enhance user experience. 
All button clicks are handled using JavaScriptâ€™s event listeners, and the expression is evaluated using the eval() function.
The calculator is responsive, user-friendly, and a great project to demonstrate practical knowledge of DOM manipulation, styling, 
and interactive UI building using core web technologies. This project was created to strengthen JavaScript fundamentals 
and experiment with CSS-based layouts.
