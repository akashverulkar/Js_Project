Live project : "https://mycurrencyconvertor-akash.netlify.app/";

Currency Converter Web App is a fully responsive and interactive project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to convert one currency to another in real-time using live exchange rates from a public
API (https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest). The app features dropdowns with dynamic country flags,
a currency swap button, and input validation to ensure smooth user experience. 
Each conversion triggers a fun animation and random background color effect in the result box. 
Designed with a clean and modern UI, this project is ideal for learning API integration, DOM manipulation, 
and responsive frontend design.
